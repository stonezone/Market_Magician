Model Monitoring and Updating: Continuously monitor the performance of the ML models and update them as needed. Retrain the models periodically with new data to ensure their predictions remain accurate and relevant.

Requirements: Install necessary libraries for working with ML and AI models, such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, or FB Prophet. Add these libraries to the requirements.txt file to manage dependencies.
By following these steps, you can successfully integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence into your trading strategy, potentially enhancing the bot's prediction accuracy and adaptability to market changes. It is essential to thoroughly test the updated trading bot with the ML models and strategies to ensure proper functioning and identify any issues or bugs.

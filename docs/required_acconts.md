It is recommended to have at least one account for each category (financial platform, news source, alternative data source, and trading platform). You can also consider adding multiple accounts for redundancy and to access different types of data or execute trades on multiple platforms. Please follow the instructions on each provider's website to obtain the necessary API keys and setup information.

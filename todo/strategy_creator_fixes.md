I can try to implement that for you. Here is a possible way to do it:

- First, you need to define a function that calculates the dynamic threshold based on some criteria. For example, you could use the standard deviation of the stock price as a measure of volatility and multiply it by a factor to get the threshold. Alternatively, you could use some other indicator or statistic that reflects the trend or momentum of the stock price. The article you provided gives some examples of how to do this.
- Second, you need to apply this function to your data and get the dynamic threshold for each row. You can use pandas apply function or vectorized operations to do this efficiently. You should store the dynamic threshold in a new column in your DataFrame.
- Third, you need to use the dynamic threshold instead of the fixed threshold to classify the buy and sell signals. You can use a custom predict function that takes the dynamic threshold as an argument and compares it with the output of your machine learning model. You should return a binary value (0 or 1) for each row based on this comparison.

Here is some sample code that illustrates these steps:

```python
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")

# Define dynamic threshold function
def dynamic_threshold(price, factor):
  # Calculate standard deviation of price
  std = np.std(price)
  # Multiply by factor
  threshold = std * factor
  # Return threshold
  return threshold

# Apply dynamic threshold function to data
df["dynamic_threshold"] = df["price"].apply(dynamic_threshold, args=(0.5,))

# Train machine learning model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Define custom predict function
def custom_predict(X, threshold):
  # Get probabilities from model
  probs = model.predict_proba(X)
  # Compare with threshold
  return (probs[:, 1] > threshold).astype(int)

# Predict buy and sell signals using dynamic threshold
df["signal"] = custom_predict(X_test, df["dynamic_threshold"])
```
